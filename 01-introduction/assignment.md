Environment Overview 📖
==========

We've created a VM with Docker installed on it, as well as a demo app for you to deploy. <br>
Once deployed, the app will be visible in the [button label="Application"](tab-2) tab (feel free to check it now, its empty). <br>

You have three tabs to interact with:

💻 **Terminal**: Run commands <br>
🏗️ **Editor**: Edit and create files <br>
🏢 **Application**: View the deployed app (to come)

Everything you interact with in this demo is customizable, to fit your products needs.

Application Deployment ✅
============

To deploy the app, run the following Docker Compose command from the  [button label="Terminal"](tab-0) tab:

```bash,run
docker-compose up -d
```

Feel free to check out the `docker-compose.yml` file within the **Editor** tab.
